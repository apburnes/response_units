      "  For rangeland conservation, effective range mangement creates sustainable cattle ranching by providing appropriate vegation with recuring growth to feed cattle herds and prevent soil erosion.  This proccess is a series of sequential steps across multiple years and growing seasons; the first steps within the integrated management process involves identifing possible soil and plant communities.  By pre-mapping unique areas across a ranch, the rangeland conservationist creates a plan of action for field collection and plant/soil inventory which will serve as a baseline for all future planning and monitory in the process.\n",

      "The goal is to produce a pre-mapping layer known as the \"response units\"(ru) which will serve to expedite the field collection/inventory by identifing the unique ecological sites within a ranch.  To produce the ru polygons, a series rasters will be stacked and segmented acording to similar values. These rasters are: SATV Vegatation Cover, Elevation, Slope, Precipitation, NHD Flowlines, and Water Flow Accumulation.  Once the data is segmented and converted to a vector polygons will be clustered according to the raster values to identify like polygons.  "
